# Django-Framework
Start Django project and Django app. We have Project "Ecommerce" and five Apps "Blog", "Cart", "Products", "Profiles", "Shop".
We connected SHOP.URLS on the main page of project (http://127.0.0.1:8000/). 
This code is only connecting Applications with Project, and all working without bugs.
